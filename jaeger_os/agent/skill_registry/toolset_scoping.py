"""Toolset scoping — the agent sees a small CORE set every turn; the
rest are grouped into named toolsets it loads on demand.

Two kinds of toolset:

  • **built-in classes** — the ~55 primitive tools grouped here by hand
    (``files``, ``code``, ``media``, …). They are not skills, just the
    raw surface, classified.
  • **skill toolsets** — registered at runtime by the skill loader. A
    skill IS a toolset: an experienced bundle of tools (+ the process
    to use them, which lives in the skill itself). The loader captures
    exactly which tools a skill registers and names that set after the
    skill — so a new skill becomes a loadable toolset with no edit here.

Why scope at all: routing accuracy on a local model degrades as the
visible tool count grows. The CORE set (~17 common tools) covers most
turns; ``load_toolset`` widens the view when a task needs more. The
active set only ever GROWS within a session, so the tool-schema KV
prefix is re-prefilled at most once per widening, never thrashed.

All tools stay REGISTERED on the agent regardless — this only controls
what appears in the schema the model sees. A tool in no toolset is
visible by default (fail-open): a new tool is never silently hidden.

    History: we flipped it ON in May 2026 after adding ``describe_tool``
    and the catalog, hoping the new pattern would offset the routing
    regression seen with naive scoping. Direct A/B against the v5
    historical baseline showed Gemma 4 26B-A4B routing dropped from
    **100% → 67.6%** under the new lean default; Qwen3.6-35B-A3B was
    largely unaffected. Conclusion: the lean surface is a real win for
    context budget but a real loss for routing on some models, and we
    can't commit to it as a global default. It stays OPT-IN until
    auto-load-on-intent (a follow-up that picks toolsets without an
    explicit meta-step) lands and re-bench shows no regression.

    ``JAEGER_TOOLSET_SCOPING=1`` enables it for context-tight runs

    redundant in the OFF default but still honoured as a kill-switch."""
