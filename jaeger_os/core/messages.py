"""JROS bus message vocabulary — the chat path.

The windowed-app surfaces (and later voice/avatar) talk to the
agent **only over the bus**, never importing agent logic — so the GUI
toolkit stays disposable (PySide6 today, maybe Swift tomorrow). A message
is any dataclass with a ``topic: str`` field; the chassis bus delivers it.

Topic convention (chassis spec): ``/act/*`` = do, ``/sense/*`` = happened,
``/sys/*`` = chassis. Mirrors
``jaeger_app_framework/demos/jros-demo/core/messages.py``, scoped to the
chat surfaces for now — hardware/avatar messages arrive when those nodes
migrate onto the chassis bus.
