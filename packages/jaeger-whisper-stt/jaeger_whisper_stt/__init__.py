"""JaegerWhisperSTT — the whisper_stt engine module, its own package.

Split out of the JROS monorepo (0.9 step 4): the module IS the engine
(see ``nodes/whisper_stt/__init__.py`` for the full architecture note).
Pins ``jaeger-os`` only — never ``jaeger-ai`` — so a robot body (JP01
and friends) can listen without the AI product installed at all.
